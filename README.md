# What is PAPR?

The purpose of this informal meeting is to bring together postdocs from the various astrononomy institutes in Pasadena (Carnegie, Caltech Astro/GPS, IPAC, and JPL), and to get to know each other's science. Building on previous years' experience, the retreat is an opportunity to cross institutional boundaries, foster new collaborations, and enrich the experience of being an astronomy postdoc in the City of Astronomy.

This (academic) year's retreat will be held sometimes next spring. The program will include a mix of brief research talks by attendees, and several social gatherings. We will also have invited spakers with academic and non-academic jobs provide career-related perspective and advice, enabling postdocs to explore a variety of career paths.

# Location

The retreat will be held at the magnificent UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference Center, which is a convenient 2 hour drive from Pasadena. Some say that Lake Arrowhead is the premier mountain resort in the San Bernardino Forest.

# Accommodations and meals

The UCLA conference center will fully accommodate and cater for us. The 'condolets' at the conference center will accommodate two, and offer a queen size bed with bath downstairs and a second queen size bed with bath upstairs. A living room area with wood-burning fireplace is shared by two conferees. All condolets have expansive decks with potential lake or forest views.

The conference center will cater for all meals, which are covered in the cost of the retreat. They will accommodate all dietary requirements detailed during registration.

# Talks 

All participants will give informal super-short (and super exciting) presentations on their research. These will be an opportunity for postdocs to develop skills in presenting compelling portraits of their work, and for the audience to learn more about the remarkable science being done around them. The exact format is being determined; please contact the organizing committee if you have any suggestions!

We will also have a few invited speakers who will give talks regarding matters relevant to the postdoc comunity like career advice, the academic job market, and the transition to industry.
